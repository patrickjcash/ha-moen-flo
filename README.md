A custom Home Assistant integration for the Moen Smart Sump Pump Monitor (model S2000ESUSA), providing real-time monitoring of water levels, temperature, humidity, pump health, and system status.

> **Note:** This device was previously branded as "Moen Flo Smart Sump Pump Monitor". The product line has been rebranded to simply "Moen Smart Sump Pump Monitor".

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
> This is an **unofficial integration** provided for **informational purposes only**. It may stop working at any time and should **NOT** be relied upon as a safety-critical monitoring system. See full [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) below. **Use at your own risk.**

## What's New in v2.4.14

💧 **Water Level sensor** — accurate, outlier-resistant basin fullness

- Replaces "Basin Fullness" with a cleaner name and smarter algorithm
- Uses a **sliding window median** over the last 20 pump cycles to set on/off thresholds — tolerates outliers and self-corrects from any corrupted state without manual intervention
- Cold starts with however many cycles have been observed; improves as the window fills

⏱️ **Next Pump Cycle sensor** — real-time prediction from the Moen backend

- Shows the timestamp when the backend estimates the next cycle will occur
- Displays as "X minutes ago" when pump is overdue (no false unavailable states)

🧹 **Cleaner UI out of the box**

- Operational sensors (Active Alerts, Last/Next Pump Cycle, Water Level, Temperature, Humidity, Water Detection) enabled by default
- Diagnostic and configuration sensors hidden by default — enable only what you need

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for complete details.

- `sensor.{device}_humidity`

**Diagnostic Sensors (enabled by default):**
- `binary_sensor.{device}_connectivity`
- `binary_sensor.{device}_ac_power`
- `sensor.{device}_battery`
- `sensor.{device}_wifi_signal`

Wait 5 minutes for the first update cycle, then verify sensor values match what you see in the Moen mobile app.

## Usage

### Monitoring Water Levels
The water level sensor reports the distance from the sensor to the water surface in millimeters. A lower value means the water level is higher (closer to the sensor).

**Important Attributes:**
- `distance_cm` - Distance in centimeters for easier reading
- `water_trend` - rising/stable/receding
- `flood_risk` - Current flood risk level
- `basin_diameter_inches` - Diameter of the sump pit (inches)
- `basin_diameter_mm` - Diameter of the sump pit (millimeters)

### Pump Health Monitoring
The Daily Pump Capacity sensor shows what percentage of the pump's daily capacity has been used. This helps identify if your pump is being overworked.

### Detailed Cycle Data
The Last Pump Cycle sensor now includes comprehensive data about each pump operation:
- **Water In Rate** - How fast water is entering the basin (gallons per minute)
- **Water In Duration** - How long water was filling
- **Water Out Volume** - Exact gallons pumped out
- **Water Out Duration** - How long the pump ran
- **Backup Pump Status** - Whether backup pump was engaged

### Flood Risk Detection
The Flood Risk binary sensor activates when:
- Water level reaches the critical threshold
- **ANY active alert is present** on the device (pump failures, water detection, power outage, etc.)

The sensor uses live telemetry from the device's AWS IoT Shadow to detect issues in real-time. All active alerts are also exposed in the sensor's attributes for detailed troubleshooting.

### Water Detection
The Water Detection binary sensor monitors the optional remote sensing cable (moisture sensor). This is separate from the water level sensor in the sump pit. The sensing cable can detect water in areas away from the sump pit, such as:
- Floor drains
- Water heater pans
- Under washing machines
- Basement floors

When water contacts the sensing cable, the sensor will turn ON and remain ON until the water is cleared.

### Alert Monitoring
The **Last Alert** sensor shows the most recent active alert from your device in plain English:
- **"Primary Pump Failed"** - Primary pump has failed to engage
- **"Backup Pump Failed"** - Backup pump has failed to engage
- **"Water Detected"** - Remote sensing cable detected water
- **"Power Outage"** - Device is running on battery backup
- **"No active alerts"** - System is healthy

The sensor attributes provide detailed information about all active and recent inactive alerts, including:
- Alert timestamps
- Alert IDs and descriptions
- Full alert state information
- Up to 5 recent inactive alerts for historical context

**Confirmed Alert Codes:**
- 232: Overflow Water Level (critical)
- 250: Water Detected (critical)
- 252: Water Was Detected (cleared)
- 254: Critical Flood Risk
- 258: Flood Risk
- 260: Main Pump Failed
- 262: Main Pump Overwhelmed
- 266: Backup Pump Test Failed
- 268: Power Outage

Unknown alert codes are displayed as "Alert {code}" with full details preserved for troubleshooting.

### Diagnostic Sensors
Diagnostic sensors are automatically hidden in the UI but can be accessed through:
1. **Device Page**: Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Moen Flo NAB → Select your device
2. **Enable in UI**: Click on a diagnostic entity and enable "Show in UI" if you want it visible

These sensors are useful for:
- Monitoring device connectivity and WiFi strength
- Tracking battery health and remaining backup power
- Viewing active device alerts and system status
- Troubleshooting connection issues

### Viewing Pump Volume Statistics

The integration automatically imports pump volume history as **long-term statistics**, which enables historical tracking and graphing. Statistics are stored separately from sensors and accessed differently.

**Three separate statistics are available:**
- **Total Pump Volume** - All pump cycles combined
- **Primary Pump Volume** - Only cycles where primary pump ran alone
- **Backup Pump Volume** - Only cycles where backup pump engaged

#### Where to Find Statistics:

**Option 1: Energy Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Energy**
2. Click **Add Consumption** in the Water section
3. Select the statistic(s) for your device (e.g., `Sump Pump Total Pump Volume`, `Sump Pump Primary Pump Volume`, `Sump Pump Backup Pump Volume`)
4. View daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly pump usage
5. Compare primary vs backup pump activity over time

**Option 2: History Panel**
1. Navigate to **History** (sidebar or `/history`)
2. Click the entity selection dropdown
3. Search for your device name (e.g., "Sump Pump")
4. Select the **statistic** (not sensor) - it will have a chart icon
5. Adjust time range to view historical data

**Option 3: Statistics Graph Card**
Add a Statistics Graph card to any dashboard:
```yaml
type: statistics-graph
entities:
  - sensor.sump_pump_water_volume
stat_types:
  - sum
period: day
```

**Option 4: Developer Tools**
1. Navigate to **Developer Tools** → **Statistics**
2. Search for your device name or "pump_volume"
3. View raw statistics data and metadata

#### Important Notes:
- **Statistics ≠ Sensors**: Statistics are stored in Home Assistant's long-term recorder database, separate from sensor entities
- **Search by Device Name**: Look for your device name (e.g., "Sump Pump Water Volume"), not "pump_volume"
- **Reload Integration**: After first installation, reload the integration to trigger statistics import
- **Historical Data**: The integration automatically backfills weeks of historical pump cycles on first load
- **Incremental Updates**: New pump cycles are automatically added to statistics during each update

## API Details

This integration uses the Moen API with AWS Cognito authentication. The API backend is shared with the "Flo" branded devices but uses a different authentication pool.

> **Developer Note:** The API internally uses the term "NAB" (Network Attached Basin) for this device type in endpoint names and identifiers. This is not user-facing and is maintained in the code for clarity when working with the API.

### Dual ID System
The API uses two different IDs for the same device:
- **UUID (`duid`)** - Used for device lists and event logs
- **Numeric ID (`clientId`)** - Used for telemetry and usage statistics

### Endpoints
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito User Pool
- **Device List**: `smartwater-app-device-api-prod-list`
- **Live Telemetry (Shadow API)**: `smartwater-app-shadow-api-prod-get` / `smartwater-app-shadow-api-prod-update`
- **Environment Data**: `fbgpg_usage_v1_get_device_environment_latest_prod` (Temperature/Humidity)
- **Pump Health**: `fbgpg_usage_v1_get_my_usage_device_history_top10_prod`
- **Pump Cycles**: `fbgpg_usage_v1_get_my_usage_device_history_prod` (Detailed cycle data)
- **Event Logs**: `fbgpg_logs_v1_get_device_logs_user_prod`

### Live Telemetry via AWS IoT Shadow
The integration uses the **AWS IoT Device Shadow** API to retrieve real-time sensor readings:

1. **Shadow Update Trigger**: Sends `sens_on` command to device via shadow update endpoint
2. **Wait Period**: Waits 3 seconds for device to take fresh sensor readings
3. **Shadow Retrieval**: Retrieves live telemetry from `state.reported` in device shadow
4. **Data Merge**: Merges fresh shadow data (water level, alerts, connectivity, etc.) with cached device data

This ensures water level readings and alert states are always current, not stale cached values. The shadow API was discovered through reverse engineering the Moen mobile app.

### Update Interval
The integration polls the API every 5 minutes by default. Each update:
- Triggers the device to take fresh sensor readings
- Retrieves live telemetry from AWS IoT Shadow
- Updates all sensor values with the latest data

This balances data freshness with API rate limits and device sensor lifespan.

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Loading
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors: **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
- Verify your credentials are correct
- Ensure your Moen account has access to the device

### Sensors Showing "Unknown" or "Unavailable"
- Wait for the next update cycle (5 minutes)
- Check that your device is online in the Moen app
- Verify device is reporting data (some fields may not be available on all models)

### Authentication Errors
- Verify your email and password are correct
- Try logging into the Moen mobile app to confirm credentials
- Check if your account requires 2FA (not currently supported)

### Temperature/Humidity Not Updating
- Ensure your device model supports these sensors
- Check the device data in the coordinator debug logs
- Some devices may not report temperature/humidity if sensors are not present

## Supported Devices
